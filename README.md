# Escape The Werehouse!
My first Python game using graphics
It is a "Boxed in" kind of game.

I have created my game with help of the PyGame framework.

The graphic and sound is made by me, or modified by me from free online content.

This was my final assignment during my course "Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3" @Udemy
