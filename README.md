# Escape The Werehouse!
My first Python game using graphics.<br>
It's a Sokoban-ish game style, that I have created with the help of [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org).

### Install the game
Please read the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/CrowStudio/Escape-The-Werehouse-/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) the docs/ folder.

This was my final assignment during my [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course [Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3]https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)
