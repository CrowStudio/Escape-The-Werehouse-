# Escape The Werehouse!
My first Python game using graphics.<br>
It's a Sokoban-ish game style, that I have created with the help of [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org).<br>

### Level Editor ###
There is a level editor to make it easier to create maps for new levels.<br>
A random map of floor and wall tiles are generated each time the editor is started, or after a level is saved, you can also regenerate the map via the Randomize Map menu.<br>

You simply add your start and exit tile, then you try to figur out a tricky way to place your pits and boxes in a way that is solvable,<br>
add extra floor tiles or wall tiles if needed. When Saving the level it will be appended to the end of game_maps.json.<br>

You can update the level path via the Edit menu, if you do not want to save to game_maps.json.<br>
