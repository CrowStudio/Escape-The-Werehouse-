# Escape The Werehouse!
My first Python game using graphics.<br>
It's a Sokoban-ish game style, that I have created with the help of [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org).

This was my final assignment during my [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course [Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)
