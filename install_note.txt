To install the game, download the blob and extract.<br>
<br>
Pygame requires Python; if you don't already have it, you can download it from python.org. <br>
Use python 3.7.7 or greater, because it is much friendlier to newbies, and additionally runs faster.<br>
<br>
The best way to install pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). <br>
Note, this comes with python in recent versions. <br>
We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally. <br>
	python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user<br>
<br>
To see if it works, run one of the included examples:<br>
<br>
	python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens<br>
<br>
If it works, you are ready to go!
